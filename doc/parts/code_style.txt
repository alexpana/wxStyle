# RTTI

* RTTI will not be used because:
	1. It implies code that manipulates code, which is not what this library does.
	2. Its use is restricted from the wxWidgets codebase, and this library must be compatible with the wxWidgets codebase.
	3. The uses of typeid and dynamic_cast usually indicate (when not used from point 1) a bad design choice.
